			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				My name is Kory Hershock and I am a Web Developer out of Marshall, MI. I obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from Olivet College. Aside from creating websites and other software, I love participating in and attending sporting events. I am currently taking projects, so if you would like to inquire about hiring me or just want to send me a message, go ahead and do so. I look forward to hearing from you.

			<h3>My Story</h3>
			<p>I was born in Detroit, MI and moved to Marshall, MI at a very young age. After High School I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with the rest of my life, so I took a couple years off college and took over the family business, Hungry Howies Pizza. After realizing that I wanted to work with computers, I went back to college and finished within a year of being back. I love the way a beutifully designed website looks and functions, and I hope to be able to provide that service and more to great people.</p>
