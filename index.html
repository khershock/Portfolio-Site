          <h2>Portfolio Concept</h2>
          <p>I would like for my portfolio to showcase professional work that I have done. I have a lot of school projects that I could display, but I want to start fresh and really brand myself as a web developer first instead of throwing bits and pieces of everything on here just to fill the page. I hope for my porfolio to be very user friendly and easy to navigate. I currently have some working knowledge in the following languages: Java, Python, C++, MIPS, Objective-C, and some HTML. As I advance further in my new career, I hope to fill out my page with pieces of work that I am truly proud of. </p>

          <h2>Project Goals</h2>
          <p>My goal for this course is to finish it within the 6 month time span. I would love to finish it as quickly as possible, but I want to make sure that I learn everything to the best of my ability before moving on. In doing this, I will ensure that when I land my first job as a web developer I will be in the right position to succeed. </p>

          <h2>Course Goals</h2>
          <p>I just recently graduated from college with a degree in Information Technology Management and decided that I am very interested in web development. By taking this course, I hope to land an entry level web development job while trying to get a freelance career off the ground. An ideal job for me would be anything to do with sports, so if I could help design user friendly websites for sports fans I believe that I would have a great chance to do well.</p>
